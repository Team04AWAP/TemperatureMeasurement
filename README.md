Description of what the project is about :
This project can be labeled as a complex web application, which is based on the phenomenon of climate change. More specifically, this project is based on the changes in temperature and carbon emission levels globally over a period of time frame. The application is built on open-access data, which is gathered by different researchers and research societies. The data is illustrated in the form of different types of graphs, for example, Line charts, Pie charts, doughnut charts, etc., and it provide visually appealing insights into these big datasets. 
Note that, in this project, the data will be displayed in the front end with help of chartjs we used MYSQL (PhpMyAdmin) for the backend. 
As mentioned earlier, in this project, we aim at providing insights on datasets and data visualization. Therefore, we have utilized different data sources, and also we have created a web application, where the data can be viewed in visually appealing graphical forms. The websites and tools are listed below which are used during the project.
The main application consists of a menu where a user can find various aspects of our implemented web application including, e.g., all the ten visualizations on the home button, the login option, and also the signup option for the new users.  
When the user navigates to home, all the visualizations can easily be accessed, and moreover, the user can easily choose and optimize, e.g., what to see in the visualization. Note that by using the different legends in graphs, a user can choose which graph to be displayed, e.g., in an efficient and adaptive manner. In addition, we also included the descriptions of the graphs under each visualization with the source database linked to it. This will allow the user to also have full access to the original information source, required information on how and where the datasets are obtained, and some more insight on the motivation each visualization holds.  
When a user navigates to the Signup, the user is provided with the option to register themselves. More specifically, the user is asked to enter their first name, last name, email address, and password. Once their credentials are entered correctly, an account is created and immediately assigned to the user, which is then easily accessible using the login option. Note that, after the Signup, our web application will itself directs the user to the login page, and thus efficiently creates a better user experience.   
After the successful log-in, the user has their own dashboard on the menu bar. When navigated to it, each user is provided with the user-specific dashboard, where they can easily create their own personalized views, e.g., in two ways.  
As an example, the user is provided with an option to choose and customize whichever visualization they want out of the ten visualizations, and then, the user can further optimize either a two-column option or a four-column option out of the four columns and efficiently create their own user-specific view.  
Along with each specific view a link is also generated, which can be made public. This is to simplify the process, e.g., anyone with this link can access, i.e., without login in every time. Note that the user can create multiple specific views, therefore, one can have multiple of such links. 
The user can also remove the specific views, they have earlier created. In addition to that, there is also an option for the user to delete their account, which they have created.  All the user specific options along with the delete user account option are available under the dashboard. So, the user can access them when they have login. 
 
Description of the project has been like: 
This project aims at providing insights into datasets and data visualization, where the data can be viewed in visually appealing graphical forms, to do that, we have used MYSQL (phpMyAdmin).To initiate the project, the first task was to have sufficient knowledge and required skills on phpMyAdmin. It took a while, but after acquiring the required knowledge and skill sets, which was pre-requisite to start this project, it became much easier to work on the manipulations of data along with the working of this diverse database.It is worth highlighting that the main part of the project, maybe, was to decide how to efficiently manipulate data in various ways, so that it could be used for different and easily understandable visualizations, which we tried to follow from the beginning.  
After that, the front-end design and implementation were completed with some more research. Specifically, the group members needed to learn front-end design with react js app. Note that our previous knowledge of basic front-end design using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and bootstrap, was very useful to complete this part in a short time.  
For the visualizations, it was necessary to study and understand chart.js, for each of the group members. However, it was a completely new concept and had no prior background. Nevertheless, we tried to study online resources, and enough knowledge of chart.js allowed us to create the visualizations and their functionality inclusive of responsiveness.Once the visualizations were done, the task was to create a user-personalized view along with a signup/login page, which allows the user to have their own user-specific dashboard.However, there were several difficulties, we have faced during the creation of user signup/login.  But our teamwork, knowledge sharing, and research made it relatively easier and gave us a head start on the creation of user-specific views.  
Our implemented user-specific view allowed the user to have diverse functionality and customization, which further made the website have more functionalities. Finally, the deployment was done, along with all the other required documentation. 
The project had several ups and downs during its production stages, but it was a learning experience for each member as it increased our knowledge of various topics. We all have actively worked in the team and efficiently collaborated with each other on all the tasks.

•	Describe at least two of these:  

The architecture of the application: 
The principles and methods used to design and construct an application are referred to as application architecture. The architecture provides a roadmap and best practices to adhere to when developing an application, ensuring that it is well-structured when finished. There are many types of web application architecture. We used ‘Progressive’ web app architecture. In progressive web applications architecture, the developer can develop a subset of application development that concentrates on the functionality of the application across a variety of different devices and web browsers. Using this method, we created we application that functions on any device, in any browser, and on any OS (Operating System) by making changes to the JavaScript, ReactJs, and CSS code.  
When we are talking about application architecture there are two most important parts of any web application the front-end and back-end. The back end focuses on the systems that power the application, whereas front-end development is concerned with the user experience. We use MYSQL as the back end and ReactJs front-end in our project and we choose ReactJS, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages. By using an architecture, developers may make sure an application is scalable, dependable, and useful. The application architecture of your software can specify how it communicates with databases and middleware. Through these interactions, you can be sure that your application will scale to meet growing user demand. 

Database structure: 

In the creation of online applications, databases are essential. It is the most important component of creating an application. Your application’s database structure is crucial to its functionality and gives you information about transactions, data integrity, and security concerns. A web application's core component is data and to store that data developers used a database. A database is a collection of information and data that has been structured for quick retrieval. Data could be anything, for example, user information, session data, and other application data. For creating Web applications there are a variety of databases such as flat files, relational databases, object-relational databases, and NoSQL databases.  
For our project, we used MYSQL (PHP my admin), where we store different types of data datasets that show the temperature and CO2 values. In our project, we created one more database which stores the that of users. A database's main function is to store, retrieve, and update data. 

UI plan: 
The entire concept of user interface design is how a web application feels and looks. It is the stage of software development where the user interface is given special attention to ensure that it is both functional and simple to use. To do this, UI designers must consider both the general navigation and functionality of the web application as well as the software requirements of their users. While creating the UI design of our project we take care of a few basic things and plan our UI design: 
•	Understand the goal of the project: 
o	First understand what the requirement of a user is, and what is the main objective of the project. 
•	Identify the main components of the UI: 
o	What are the main elements of the user interface, and what are the user interface design and layout should be? 
•	Keep the UI simple:  
o	Clear language and avoiding inessential features are key practices for simple interfaces. 
•	Be consistent: 
o	Use common UI components to maintain consistency. Use components that users are familiar with. 
•	Be responsive: 
o	A website with responsive design shows the same content to all devices, but styles it differently based on the screen size. 

•	How to install and use the application: 
o	The application is a web application, which the user will access via a URL, as the web application will be hosted publicly on Google Cloud. And we also provide the GitHub link in this document. So, if someone wants to check the website from GitHub, first he/she will clone the repository in visual studio code, and then on the terminal of visual studio code, he/she must write “npm start” for running the react app in the browser. After that start a new terminal and should write “cd server” and then “npm run devStart” by this command back-end will run, we use MYSQL(PhpMyAdmin) as a back end so the back user should start XAmpp first and we also provide the databases SQL file, the files should be imported in PhpMyAdmin after that back-end will work and application will run. The web application shows the different visualizations of Co2 and temperature over a period. There are also Signup and login functions there, once the user gets a login, he/she can create resources, which means the user can be able to create his own visualization view with a unique URL. In the view, the user can select the data visualizations they want, choose the layout they want, and write a description text for each visualization.
